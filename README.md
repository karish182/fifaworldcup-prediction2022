FIFA World Cup Prediction 2022
Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of FIFA World Cup 2022 matches using machine learning techniques, data science principles, and data scraped from Wikipedia. By leveraging historical data and applying predictive modeling, we can generate insights into potential match outcomes and tournament winners.
Data Sources
FIFA Rankings Data: Historical FIFA rankings data is sourced from FIFA's official website.
World Cup Results Data: Historical World Cup match results are collected from various reliable sources.
Scraped Data: Additional data such as team statistics, player information, and match details are scraped from Wikipedia using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.
Model Details
We employ a supervised machine learning approach to predict match outcomes based on historical data. The model incorporates features such as team rankings, previous match performances, player statistics, and other relevant factors.

Visualizations
Correlation Matrix: Visualize the relationships between different features and their correlation with match outcomes.
Match Predictions: Plot the predicted outcomes of FIFA World Cup 2022 matches based on the trained model.
Results and Evaluation
After training the model and making predictions, we evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we compare the predictions against actual match results to assess the model's effectiveness.

Future Improvements
Incorporate real-time data updates during the tournament for more accurate predictions.
Explore advanced machine learning algorithms such as ensemble methods, neural networks, or deep learning for improved accuracy.
Enhance feature engineering by including additional data sources or creating more sophisticated features.
